## The problem worth solving

A media buyer at an affiliate company runs spend across **Google, Meta, Taboola, and TikTok**.
The data lives in four dashboards with four schemas. The real job — *what do I do with the next
dollar?* — is done by hand, every morning, under pressure. That single decision is the
highest-leverage point in the entire ROI loop, and it's the one thing creative generators,
ad-upload workflows, and landing-page builders **don't** touch.

## What Lever does

Lever is the **decision brain** that sits on top of your spend:

- 📥 **Ingests** normalized performance from every channel (CSV upload or a seeded demo).
- 🧮 **Computes** what actually matters to a list-builder: **CPA, EPC, ROAS, profit** — not vanity metrics.
- 🎯 **Recommends** the highest-leverage moves — **Pause · Scale · Refresh creative · Review · Reallocate** —
  each ranked by **projected dollar impact**, a **confidence** score, and a transparent formula.
- 🎯 **Target-aware** — raise your ROAS goal above breakeven and profitable-but-under-target entities are flagged **Review** instead of being called "healthy".
- 🩸 **Catches budget leaks** — spend burning with zero conversions is flagged as the *most urgent* move.
- 📉 **Detects creative fatigue three ways** — CTR below the channel median, a sharp single-period drop, *and* a sustained multi-period decline versus the creative's recent peak.
- 💎 **Values first-party LTV** — feed a known lifetime value per conversion (per entity *or* a per-channel default) and the engine optimizes on *true downstream value*, not just immediately-attributed revenue.
- 🚦 **Spots budget-capped winners** — a strong performer pinned near its spend cap is throttled demand, so the Scale call flags the cap to raise and carries higher confidence.
- 🧭 **Scores the account** with a single 0–100 **health** number and a **per-channel breakdown** for the exec view.
- 🎛️ **What-if simulator** — tune the engine's thresholds live and watch the action feed re-rank.
- 📤 **Exports** the ranked actions to CSV for ad-ops, and **persists** datasets (in-memory → Firestore).
- 🔌 **Connects live data** — pull real campaign reports straight from **Google Ads, Meta, Taboola, and TikTok** free-tier APIs; API keys are sealed in an **AES-256-GCM encrypted vault** (decrypted only in-process) and results auto-**sync to a Google Sheet** (newest-first) via Apps Script. Every network seam is **timeout-bounded with retrying backoff** (429/5xx-aware), so a free-tier rate-limit blip never fails an ingest run.
- 🤝 **Argues for itself**: every recommendation shows the math, so a buyer can act on it *and defend it*.

> It doesn't optimize vanity ROAS. It optimizes **profit against target** — the affiliate north-star.

## Why it wins

| Most tools | Lever |
|---|---|
| Make more creative / upload ads / build pages | Tells you **what to change and why** |
| Vanity ROAS dashboards | **Profit-objective**, dollar-ranked actions |
| Black-box "AI suggestions" | **Deterministic + explainable** — every move shows its formula |

The core is an **explainable, profit-objective recommendation engine**: pure, deterministic,
200 unit tests, with a clean seam to attach an LLM for richer natural-language rationales.

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000  — boots on a seeded 4-channel dataset
```

Drop in any ad-platform CSV (schema-tolerant — it understands `cost`/`spend`,
`conversion_value`/`revenue`, `platform`/`channel`, …) and the action feed re-ranks instantly.

Drive the engine programmatically (or from an agent/MCP client):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/analyze \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"csv":"campaign,platform,cost,conversion_value,leads,clicks,impressions\nSolar,Google,1000,2500,40,500,12000"}'
```

## 🔬 Verify it yourself

```bash
npm test             # 200 passing — engine, metrics, confidence, storage, CSV, export, secrets vault, channel connectors, Sheets sync, ingest pipeline, API routes
npm run build        # production build + full TypeScript check
```

On the seeded dataset the engine flags **$8,269 of recommended impact** across the portfolio —
catching a budget leak (spend with zero conversions), pausing money-losers, scaling winners,
and refreshing fatigued creative — plus a **separate ~$1,008 budget-reallocation** opportunity
(capped at what the winner can absorb at quoted efficiency; never double-counted into the
headline) and an overall **account health of 80/100**.

## Architecture

```
src/lib/engine.ts       ← the core: profit-objective recommendation engine + account health (deterministic)
src/lib/metrics.ts      ← pure metric derivations (CPA, EPC, ROAS, …) + confidence + channel rollup
src/lib/csv.ts          ← schema-tolerant CSV → canonical rows + untrusted-payload sanitizer
src/lib/export.ts       ← ranked recommendations → escaped CSV
src/lib/storage.ts      ← StorageAdapter seam (in-memory ↔ Firestore, env-selected, memoized)
src/app/page.tsx        ← dashboard: KPIs, health, channel breakdown, what-if sliders, action feed
src/app/api/analyze     ← analyze + optional persist (agent/MCP entry point)
src/app/api/datasets    ← list persisted datasets
src/lib/secrets.ts      ← AES-256-GCM encrypted credential vault (file ↔ in-memory, scrypt-derived key)
src/lib/channels/*      ← free-tier API connectors (google·meta·taboola·tiktok): normalize → AdRow[]
src/lib/sheets.ts       ← newest-first, de-duplicated Google-Sheets sync payload + push client
src/lib/pipeline.ts     ← ingest (connectors) → analyze → persist → sync orchestration
apps-script/Code.gs     ← Apps Script web app: upsert newest-first, daily trigger, retention trim
src/app/api/credentials ← seal/list/remove channel API keys (never readable back; admin-gated)
src/app/api/ingest      ← run the real-data pipeline for a reporting window (admin-gated)
src/app/api/cron/ingest ← Vercel Cron entry point: same pipeline, daily 2-day trailing window (bearer-gated)

```

## Going to production

- **Deployed**: live on Vercel at **[lever-sepia.vercel.app](https://lever-sepia.vercel.app)** —
  a stock Next.js app, zero config. Reproduce with `vercel --prod`.
- **Persistence**: `FirestoreStorage` is already implemented against the `StorageAdapter`
  interface in `src/lib/storage.ts`; the engine and UI need **zero changes**. Set
  `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`, and `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` as Vercel
  environment variables and `createStorage()` switches from in-memory to Firestore automatically.
- **Live data**: free-tier channel connectors are implemented (`src/lib/channels/*`) behind the
  same `AdRow[]` contract. Seal each platform's API keys via `POST /api/credentials` (sealed with
  AES-256-GCM under `LEVER_SECRET_KEY`, never returned over HTTP), then run `POST /api/ingest`.
  Google Ads also accepts a long-lived `refreshToken`+`clientId`+`clientSecret` instead of a static
  `accessToken` — Lever mints a fresh access token from Google's OAuth2 endpoint on every call, so
  there's no manual token rotation.
- **Multi-tenant**: every credential write/read/delete, `/api/ingest`, and `/api/cron/ingest` accept
  an optional `accountId`. Two tenants' credentials for the same channel are stored under
  independent, non-colliding vault keys (`vaultKey(channel, accountId)`); omit it and everything
  falls back to the original single-tenant account — existing zero-config deployments are unaffected.
- **Google Sheets**: deploy `apps-script/Code.gs` as a web app, set `LEVER_SHEETS_WEBHOOK_URL` +
  `LEVER_SHEETS_TOKEN`, and every ingest upserts results into your sheet newest-first, with a
  daily maintenance trigger.
- **Config write-back**: add a `Config` tab (`key`/`value` rows) to the same sheet and edit engine
  thresholds (`targetRoas`, `minSpend`, `scaleStep`, ...) by hand — the next ingest run reads them
  back automatically (`GET ?action=config`), no redeploy or API call needed. A caller-supplied
  `config` still wins per-key over the sheet.
- **Hands-off scheduling**: `vercel.json` registers a daily Vercel Cron hitting
  `GET /api/cron/ingest` — no manual trigger needed. Set `LEVER_CRON_SECRET`; Vercel Cron sends
  it back as `Authorization: Bearer <secret>`, checked in constant time (fails closed in
  production if unset). Override the trailing window with `?days=N` for a manual backfill.
